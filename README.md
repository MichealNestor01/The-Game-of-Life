# The-Game-of-Life

This is my own version of Conway's game of life, except it is on a 50 x 50 grid. Each generation takes 100ms, and I also coded in a reset function which allows a user to, with a single press of the reset button, put the board back to how it was before the simulation started, pressing it a second time clear the board.
